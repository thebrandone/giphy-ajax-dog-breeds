## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to be able to dynamically create buttons and then use those buttons to query an API (in this case it was GIPHY). Once the API is queried, it will display certain information from the API Object and display it onto the page.

## How-To

Click on one of the Dog Breed Buttons listed at the top or input your own and click **Add a dog breed!** to create a new button to click. Upon clicking a button, dog gifs of that breed will appear. You can click on the gif to get it to animate and you can click on the gif again to make it stop animating.

## Resources used

For this assignment I used [jquery](https://code.jquery.com/) and the [GIPHY API.](https://developers.giphy.com/)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I had fun creating this application as it was a good learning experience for API calls. The Giphy API is very useful for learning API calls as it has many forms of gifs and images that can be called, as seen in this application with the ability to 'pause' the gif by clicking on it.
