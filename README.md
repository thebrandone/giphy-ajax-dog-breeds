# giphy-ajax-dog-breeds

## This code's goal:

The purpose of this code is to be able to dynamically create buttons and then use those buttons to query an API (in this case it was GIPHY). Once the API is queried, it will display certain information from the API Object and display it onto the page.

###Resources used:

For this assignment I used [jquery](https://code.jquery.com/) and the [GIPHY API.](https://developers.giphy.com/)
